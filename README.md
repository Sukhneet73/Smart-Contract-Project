ErrorHandlingExample Smart Contract
This Solidity smart contract demonstrates basic error handling techniques using require(), assert(), and revert() statements. It includes functions for depositing and withdrawing Ether, as well as examples to showcase assertion and revert functionalities.

Contract Details
Contract Address: [Deployed Contract Address on Ethereum Mainnet/Ropsten/etc.]
Compiler Version: Solidity ^0.8.0
License: MIT License
Functions:
Constructor

Initializes the contract owner as the deployer (msg.sender).
deposit()

Allows users to deposit Ether into the contract.
Requires that the deposited amount is greater than 0.
withdraw(uint256 amount)

Allows users to withdraw Ether from their balance.
Requires that the user has sufficient balance to withdraw the requested amount.
assertExample(uint256 x)

Demonstrates the use of assert() to ensure there's no arithmetic overflow when calculating x * 2.
revertExample(uint256 divisor)

Demonstrates the use of require() to ensure the divisor is not zero before performing a division operation.
Throws a revert error if the divisor is zero.
destroyContract()

Allows the contract owner to self-destruct the contract.
Requires that the caller is the contract owner (msg.sender == owner).
Note: The use of selfdestruct is discouraged in new contracts due to recent changes in Ethereum's behavior. It's included here for demonstration purposes.
Usage:
Deployment

Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum network of your choice (Mainnet, Ropsten, etc.).
Use a Solidity compiler that supports version ^0.8.0 or higher.
Interacting with the Contract

After deployment, interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or other contracts.
Use functions like deposit(), withdraw(), assertExample(), revertExample(), and destroyContract() as per the contract's functionality.
Security Considerations

Ensure that only authorized users can call sensitive functions (withdraw(), destroyContract()).
Understand and mitigate risks associated with selfdestruct and other operations.
